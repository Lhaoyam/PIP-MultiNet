# PIP-MultiNet
Proinflammatory-inducing peptides (PIPs) play a crucial role in mediating immune responses and have attracted increasing interest as potential therapeutic agents for treating inflammation-related diseases. However, identifying PIPs through laboratory experiments remains costly and time-consuming, making computational approaches an essential alternative for large-scale candidate screening. This repository presents PIP-TreeNet, a two-level learning framework that predicts PIPs directly from peptide sequences by integrating multiple types of sequence-derived features and combining the outputs of several decision tree classifiers to enhance prediction accuracy and generalization capability.
PIP-TreeNet integrates multiple types of sequence-derived features—including amino acid composition, sequence-order properties, evolutionary information, and deep protein language model embeddings (from ESM)—to construct a comprehensive feature representation. It employs a two-level decision tree–based architecture, combining predictions from multiple base classifiers (such as Random Forest, Extra Trees, and XGBOOST) through a meta-classifier (LGBM) to improve prediction robustness and accuracy.

PIP-TreeNet achieves strong performance on benchmark datasets and demonstrates high generalization ability across different peptide types. This tool is intended to support researchers in peptide discovery pipelines by offering an efficient, scalable, and reproducible solution for predicting proinflammatory peptide activity.
