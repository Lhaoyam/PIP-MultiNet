# PIP-MultiNet
Proinflammatory peptides (PIPs) are short bioactive sequences capable of inducing inflammatory responses in the host. Most existing computational methods for pro-inflammatory peptide prediction remain confined to single-task classification, lacking an integrated analysis spanning sequence, structure, and function. To overcome this limitation, we propose PIP-MultiNet, integrating classification, saturation mutagenesis, molecular dynamics simulations, and molecular docking techniques. PIP-MultiNet consists of three stages: i) PIP-MultiNet employs a dual-layer architecture that integrates decision hyperplane stability with cross-modal features combining physicochemical properties and ESM Cambrian embeddings, significantly enhancing the model's capability to capture decision boundaries and sequence semantic information. ii) Saturated mutagenesis was integrated with protein language model predictions to enable high-dimensional feature-driven sequence optimization. iii) Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and molecular docking were employed to investigate the effects of mutations on structure and function. Experimental evaluation on the independent dataset ProInTest shows that, compared with the current state-of-the-art method, PIP-MultiNet achieves a 14% improvement in MCC, a 14% improvement in AUC, and a 7.1% improvement in ACC. This study pioneers the application of protein language models to saturation mutagenesis prediction, constructing an innovative mutant library encompassing the entire sequence space with 5,520 mutations, enabling high-throughput, low-cost virtual screening of peptide sequence space. PIP-MultiNet establishes a closed-loop analytical workflow from sequence to structure to function, providing a unified theoretical and technical framework for the prediction, screening, and design of pro-inflammatory peptides.
